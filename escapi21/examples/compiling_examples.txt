In order to compile the examples, compile escapi.cpp as well
and link the example with it. In case of multicap you will
also need to link with SDL. For SDL set-up instructions,
please see http://iki.fi/sol/gp/

The bin directory contains pre-compiled versions of the examples.


The "blizmax" and "purebasic" directories contain examples for 
those software packages donated by third parties.

If you make escapi useful in other environments, I'd love to
include them in the escapi distribution!
