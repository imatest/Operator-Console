This is a simple public domain example demonstrating usage of the ESCAPI 2.0
package in BlitzMax.

You need to place escapi.dll in the same folder as this source code. (You'll
therefore have to save the code before running it.) This DLL is part of the
escapi20.zip package available from http://sol.gfxile.net/code.html

By default, this example uses the first capture device found (number 0) and
grabs directly to a standard BlitzMax PixMap.
